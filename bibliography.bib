  abstract = {The key component in forecasting demand and consumption of resources in a supply network is an accurate prediction of real-valued time series. Indeed, both service interruptions and resource waste can be reduced with the implementation of an effective forecasting system. Significant research has thus been devoted to the design and development of methodologies for short term load forecasting over the past decades. A class of mathematical models, called Recurrent Neural Networks, are nowadays gaining renewed interest among researchers and they are replacing many practical implementations of the forecasting systems, previously based on static methods. Despite the undeniable expressive power of these architectures, their recurrent nature complicates their understanding and poses challenges in the training procedures. Recently, new important families of recurrent architectures have emerged and their applicability in the context of load forecasting has not been investigated completely yet. This work performs a comparative study on the problem of Short-Term Load Forecast, by using different classes of state-of-the-art Recurrent Neural Networks. The authors test the reviewed models first on controlled synthetic tasks and then on different real datasets, covering important practical cases of study. The text also provides a general overview of the most important architectures and defines guidelines for configuring the recurrent networks to predict real-valued time series},

  abstract = {Several continuous-time and discrete-time recurrent neural network models have been developed and applied to various engineering problems. One of the difficulties encountered in the application of recurrent networks is the derivation of efficient learning algorithms that also guarantee the stability of the overall system. This paper studies the approximation and learning properties of one class of recurrent networks, known as high-order neural networks; and applies these architectures to the identification of dynamical systems. In recurrent high-order neural networks, the dynamic components are distributed throughout the network in the form of dynamic neurons. It is shown that if enough high-order connections are allowed then this network is capable of approximating arbitrary dynamical systems. Identification schemes based on high-order network architectures are designed and analyzed.{$<>$}},

The network has a regular structure, exhibits much faster learning, and is amenable to the incremental addition of units to attain a desired level of complexity. Simulation results show good convergence properties and accuracy for function approximation. Comparative results using the DARPA acoustic transient data set are also provided to highlight the classification abilities of pi-sigma networks.{$<>$}},
